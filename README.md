# üëã Todo List
**What is this?**
This project is for my teaching curriculum for my students to follow. 
The todo list is a great starting project for beginner programmers to get the hang of implementing their knowledge in programming. It allows a student to make something *useful* out of what they've learnt and acts as an introduction into real world use cases of the different aspects of React and programming in general. 

Sure, it's not perfect. Non of your first projects will be. What matters is that you learn from your mistakes and use them to improve and do better on your next project. Of course, in an deal world, we'd have the data saving to a server. But this is a great starting point!

The project itself uses the following libraries:
* React
* Material UI

# üìö What you will learn
This project, as mentioned earlier, is perfect for teaching beginners real world uses of React and its UI libraries. Completing this project will teach you:
- [x] How to create a list of checkboxes for an array of data.
- [x] Taking advantage of slick material UI using the Material UI library
- [x] How to create pop up dialogs with custom text boxes.
- [x] How to use the Grid API within material UI for responsive design.

I'd typically expect students to be able to finish this project in 2-3 weeks. However, everyone is different and it's completely fine to get stuck. Everyone has their different strenghts and strifes, and I will work alongside you to support you through anything you get stuck on.

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Advice
Please only use my code as a reference, do not copy it (as in copy and paste, obviously it will be a useful reference!). Feel free to change it up a little bit, be inspired by my code and make some changes! Thats what programming is about and its also how you learn. Learn from my code, don't copy it.  Chances are, you can probably do better than me in a lot of areas!

I also suggest that my students don't work any longer than 30 minutes at a time to begin with, take 10 minute breaks after half an hour and continue. I intend my students to work with what is called the Pomodoro Technique if its at all possible for them to follow. This is because programming is a very cognitively intense task, and the pomodoro technique will help keep your brain fresh, prevent burnout and allow for more time to consider your aproaches.
